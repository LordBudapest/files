  "ocplib-simplex: A library implementing a simplex algorithm, in a functional style, for solving systems of linear inequalities"
description:
  "ocplib-simplex is a (fully) functional OCaml implementation of the simplex algorithm for solving systems of linear inequalities. The implementation is incremental and backtrackable. It is able to extract unsat-cores for unsatisfiable problems. Versions > 0.1 also support linear optimization."
